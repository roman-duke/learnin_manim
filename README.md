# Getting started with Manim
This project contains all the exercises/mini-projects done while getting conversant with Manim. [Manim](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/guides/deep_dive.html) is a python library for math animations developed by the YouTube math stardom, Grant Sanderson([3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown)).

## Installing Manim
To install manim, refer to [this](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html)

## Current Mini Projects 
- Binary Search Algorithm.
- Random Shuffle Animation.  

## Run Project Animations
Right now, all the animation scenes are in one file (to be modularized later)
To run any of them, type the following command in terminal
```
manim -pqh slama_part_I.py 
```
Then choose from any of the Scenes available.
